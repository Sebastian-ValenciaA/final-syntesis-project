<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    According to the linear regresion, the energy consumption in kwh tends to
    increase over time, because of the constand use different electric gadgets
    like computers, washing machinea, among others elements in the cotidian
    life.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The real energy consumption resides in the fact that each point is pretty
    far from the other ones, son the linear regression is not always exact.
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>In the next month the estimated energy i will consume is 247,8kwh.</p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    Energy needs to decrease because it is possible that in the future it will
    cause the depletion of resources, the difficulty of supplying, energy
    dependence and environmental pollution.
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    In the graphic i see that the linear regression it is in constant up, this
    is because if more people live in the house the energy consuming is more
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The relationship between linear regression and red points is that the true
    consume points is more near each other so the graphic is more easy to
    express
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>
    the energy consumed in a residential unit where 200 people live is from
    14442.28kwh
  </p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p></p>
</ul>
