<h3>Electric energy</h3>
<p>
    It is the energy form that results from the difference of potential
    between two points, that allows the existence of an electric current, which
    is the flow of electric charge (usually electrons). The electrical
    energy is carried in the electric and magnetic fields associated
    with how charges are arranged and moved.

<h3>The Watt (physical unit)</h3>
<p>Is the Intercontinental System of Units (SI) standard unit of power (energy per unit of time),and its equivalent to one Joule per second; that is to say that a Watt is the amount of energy that an electrical device is burning per second that is running. </br>
 To sum up, it is defined by the reason between Jouloes (unit of work) and seconds (unit of time).</p>

 <h3>Scatter plot</h3>
 <p>Also known as dispercion grahp, uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables.<br/>
The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point</p>

<h3>Linear regression</h3>
<p>Linear regression is defined as an algorithm that provides a linear relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of future events.
  Is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

<h3>Renewable energy</h3>
<p>
  According to the United Nations, is the energy derived from natural resources that at replenished.This energy includes the solar, wind and geothermal energy.
