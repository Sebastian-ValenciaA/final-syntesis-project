<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    This linear regression analysis confirms the decreasing trend in energy
    consumption observed in the provided data, with an approximate decrease of
    1.25 kWh per month. However, it's important to note that linear regression
    is a statistical tool and may not necessarily reflect the complete reality.
    Other factors and variables can influence energy consumption and should be
    considered in a comprehensive analysis.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The estimated relationship between the months' data and kW expenditure is
    not very strong, suggesting that there may be other factors or variables not
    considered in this analysis that could be influencing energy expenditure.
    External variables such as changes in weather, users consumption habits,
    fluctuations in energy prices, device energy efficiency, among others, could
    be affecting the observed trend
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>in the month of april we could stimated than i will use 115.90 Kwh</p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    Based on these findings, it may be beneficial to focus on reducing energy
    consumption over time through the implementation of energy-saving measures
    or promoting energy-efficient practices. Additionally, educating and raising
    awareness among stakeholders about the importance of energy conservation and
    sustainable energy practices could also play a key role in long-term energy
    consumption reduction. Not only can we contribute to environmental
    sustainability, but also achieve cost savings and improve overall energy
    efficiency.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    The regression line shows a positive slope in this case, indicating that as
    the number of residents increases, energy consumption also tends to
    increase. This positive correlation suggests that with a higher number of
    residents, there is an increase in energy demand, possibly due to higher
    usage of appliances, heating systems, lighting, and other general energy
    needs.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The relationship between energy expenditure in kW and linear regression is
    strong, indicating that there is a significant correlation between the two
    variables. However, it is important to acknowledge that the number of people
    may also be a determining factor in explaining energy expenditure. Other
    variables that were not included in the analysis could potentially be
    playing a secondary role or have a minor impact on the relationship.
    Therefore, it is crucial to consider the possibility of additional factors
    influencing energy expenditure beyond just linear regression, including the
    number of people or other variables not accounted for in the analysis
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>
    in a residential unit with 200 pepol living we could Estimate than they will
    use 14211.75 kWh
  </p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    The relationship between two variables is determined by their capacity to
    influence each other. In the case of the presented data analysis, a
    relationship was found between electricity consumption in kilowatt-hours
    (kWh) and the number of residents in a household. Some possible reasons for
    this relationship could be that as the number of residents in a household
    increases, the usage of appliances and electronic devices also increases,
    resulting in higher electricity consumption
