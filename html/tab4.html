   <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
   <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
     For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
   </p>
   <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
   <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
   <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
   <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
     </p>
     <ul>
           <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
           <p> Looking at the graphic, we can notice that there is a tendency to reduce the energy consumption through the months. Also, it is mandatory to realize that the dots are distributed in a way that the regression line can represent with some accuracy the data collected. </p>
           <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
           <p>The real energy consumption data has a tendency to decrease that is even observable without the regression line. Despite this, the dots are moderately far from the line made with the linear regression </p>
           <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
           <p> According to the equation, the next month I will consume 110,4 kWh.</p>
           <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li>
         <p>I should reduce the energy consumption in my house through actions like saving my phone battery, turning off the electrical devices while they are not being used (the same with the lightbulbs) and taking advantage of the natural light during the day.  </p>
     </ul>
   <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
   <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
   <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
   <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
   <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
   </p>
   <ul>
        <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
<p>It can be explained from the fact that the relation between the amount of people and the energy consumption is directly proportional, so it is to be expected an increment.
   </p>
        <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
<p> The relation between the real data and the tendency demarcated with the line lies in the fact that there are some dots very close to the line, while other ones are too far from it, so it is difficult to determinate the accuracy of the function.
   </p>
        <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
<p> Paying attention to the line equation, 200 people would consume 363.127 kWh.
   </p>
        <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
<p></p>
     </ul>
